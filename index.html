                    The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. 
                    Though primarily affiliated with the interests of the United States of America, the group's purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. 
                    The Avengers were assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a result of the Avengers Initiative, when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri army. 
                    The first iteration of the team, consisting of Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye, defeated Loki in the Battle of New York to stop the Chitauri Invasion.

                        Fury began his career of serving his nation within the United States Army, rising to the rank of Colonel before becoming a CIA operative during the Cold War. 
                        Fury then joined S.H.I.E.L.D., where he recruited and trained Phil Coulson and John Garrett. 
                        In 1995, Fury met Vers and the Skrull General Talos and helped Vers uncover her human heritage as Carol Danvers. 
                        The trio fought the Starforce, led by Yon-Rogg, who were targeting Skrull refugees. 
                        Fury took a liking to Goose, although she scratched and permanently blinded Fury's left eye. 
                        While Danvers then left Earth in order to find a new home for the Skrulls, Fury would summon a team of Skrulls to Earth to secretly aid him with his spy career in exchange for helping them find a home.

                        With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. 
                        With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. 
                        Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. 
                        Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.

                        Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth, where he was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. 
                        The serum greatly enhanced Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels. 
                        After Erskine's assassination and being doubted by SSR head director Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond campaigns, where he posed as a patriotic mascot under the moniker of Captain America.
